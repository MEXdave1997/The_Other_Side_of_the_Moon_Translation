All Copyright goes to the [Carley Eissman Foundation](http://www.carleyeissmanfoundation.com/). Permissions were given to translate the book only, so I only ask for this to be respected as such.

__NOTE__: This work will be heavily moderated due to the nature of it's content, and any unecessary comments/edits will be removed and closed.
